# F-Droid Repository

Our own F-Droid repository contains the Google Services which is not possible in the main F-Droid repository.

## Add Repository to F-Droid

Easiest way to add the Repository is to either scan the QR-Code or if you are on your phone directly click it.

### If the QR-Code doesn't work:

First check if you have f-droid installed. If not you can get it from: [https://f-droid.org/](https://f-droid.org/).
After you made sure you installed it and you didn't have it installed before you can try again the QR-Code.
If this still isn't working follow the next steps:

1. Open the f-droid App
2. Go to the `Settings` Tab in the Bottom bar
3. Click the `Repositories` Action
4. Click on the plus sign at the top.
5. Fill in `https://fdroid.fluffychat.im` into the top field and `8E2637AEF6697CC6DD486AF044A6EE45B1A742AE3EF56566E748CDE8BC65C1FB` in the bottom field.
